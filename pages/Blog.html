	Information Technology is the new revolution in the market. It has changed the people live, eat and travel. It has lead us to highly convenient lifestyle that we had never expected before the internet. The most we have got from the internet is communication and with no doubt e-commerce takes second place. Ecommerce has changed how we people buy/sell things and also has changed how can the business be done.<br><br>
<!-- br us used for line break -->
    Read on to see how the e-commerce has helped the small business owners with their style of working.<br><br> 
 
    1. Distant Outreach <br>
    		Imagine living in our country and wanting the things that are only found best in U.S.A. It was very hard to reach the customer base for the companies before the internet hit the world. Now just click the button pay the money and here you go. This has now changed the lives of small business owners by giving the opportunity to grow.<br><br>
    2.Easy to start<br><br><br>
     Just open a website and buy the products from the dealer and deliver if you want like daraz.com.np just make the third party website like hamrobazar.com where you are only the source when two people are buying and selling things. It's so easy to start that in Nepal there are more than enough people already doing it. You do not need a whole office for business, grab a laptop with internet, get a website and with some editing and writing skills anyone can do it.<br><br>

     3. Easy to get paid for the products<br><br>
     The customers will  use their credit card, paypal or in the context of nepal E-sewa or Khalti. But not all people are used to this kind or online payment in Nepal or any other country. That is where Cash on Delivery (COD) comes in handy. Deliver and get paid. It is easy as that.<br><br><br>
     4. No third party<br><br>
     If you have ever played games, you know what a third party means. Basically it just means you finish the business and  from nowhere a person comes over and takes more profit than you who is selling the actual product. It is never beneficial for you rather in games or while doing the business. Here, you are able to sell the product to the buyer in a much lower price and therefore there will be more buyers for the product which in turn increases the profits of business.<br><br><br>
     5.Opens anytime<br><br>
     An online shop is available  24*7, whenever and wherever you want. In the busy world its harder to get time for shopping. There is nothing just stopping you that means more sales which generates more profit. Just watch a cricket game,eating popcorn and order and there you go, get your product on you doorstep. You do not even have to wait till Sunday, Saturday or any day off for the shopping. Buyers can spend as much as time and money as much as they want which is beneficial for them as well as us.
